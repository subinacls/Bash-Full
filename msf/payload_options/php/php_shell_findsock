Description:
  Spawn a shell on the established connection to the webserver. 
  Unfortunately, this payload can leave conspicuous evil-looking 
  entries in the apache error logs, so it is probably a good idea to 
  use a bind or reverse shell unless firewalls prevent them from 
  working. The issue this payload takes advantage of (CLOEXEC flag not 
  set on sockets) appears to have been patched on the Ubuntu version 
  of Apache and may not work on other Debian-based distributions. Only 
  tested on Apache but it might work on other web servers that leak 
  file descriptors to child processes.
