Name   Current Setting  Required  Description

LHOST                   yes       The listen address
LPORT  4444             yes       The listen port

  Listen for a connection and spawn a command shell. This 
  implmentation does not include ebcdic character translation, so a 
  client with translation capabilities is required. MSF handles this 
  automatically.
